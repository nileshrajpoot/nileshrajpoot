                   <h4>Tip #1 Getting The Lip Roll Started</h4>

In the beginning, if your technique isn’t the greatest it can be a little challenging to get the lip roll started.
A trick to help you get things going is to place your hands and hold your cheeks up. Watch the video above for a demonstration of this.
Now, as you practice the exercise more and more you’ll notice that you’ll have less need to use your hands on your cheeks.
What this means is your swallowing muscles are starting to sit still when your singing… This is a sign that your technique is improving and your voice is on the right track!
When your singing technique is solid you won’t have any need for your hands at all.
As a side note, this exercise really does teach you how to sing properly better than just about every other exercise… So don’t be surprised if before long you’re singing without the hands!
Sing Through Your Vocal Registers More Easily
Another thing you’ll notice as you learn how to sing properly with the lip roll exercise, is you’ll be able to sing up through your vocal range more easily.
Instead of there being noticeable gaps between your lower notes and your higher notes, this exercise will create a smooth transition. After a while, people won’t be able to hear any difference in tone quality throughout your entire range.<br>
<h4>Tip 2# How To Sing Properly</h4>
To practice this technique properly, you need to imagine that your sound is above your cheeks.
This will keep everything in position and your sound flowing through your body correctly.
It also keeps your sound from falling back into your throat, which in the long run will cause you lot’s of problems!<br>
<h4>Tip 3# Stop Reaching For Those High Notes</h4>
Another little singing tip to use while practicing the lip roll exercise is to “think” you’re singing down into the note as you sing higher.
This is another little trick that will keep you from “reaching up” to your higher notes.
Remember that to sing your highest notes, all that needs to happen is a little vocal chord adjustment. So there is no need to “point” your body upwards to reach that note.
If you “think” down as you go for these high notes, you’ll keep your body in position and your vocal chords will automatically make the adjustments necessary to get that note.

               <h2>Some Rule for singing strong voice</h2>
               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">1.   Sit or stand up straight with your muscles relaxed. Keeping your back straight and your posture neutral will allow your diaphragm and lungs to expand properly as well as encourage air flow. Since your singing power originates in the diaphragm making a point of relaxing the rest of the body will help you refocus your attention on the parts of the body that,matter.
                   2.
Breathe from your diaphragm. The diaphragm is a muscle beneath the lungs that contracts whenever you breathe in, allowing your lungs to expand into that space. Expelling air is therefore a question of allowing the diaphragm to relax in controlled, gradual manner. To test what it feels like to breathe through your diaphragm, bend over at the waist and sing. Notice the feeling in your stomach and the sound that you create.
Don't ever breathe in through your nose; it will make it harder to reach high notes. 
                 
3.Warm up before starting to sing. Make nonsense sounds (ex. expelling air to forcibly flap your lips by and create a b-b-b-b-b or p-p-p-p-p sound, making a prolonged "shhhhh" sound, and so on), covering different consonants and vowels to engage different facial muscles. This produces a richer, less strained sound. (When you blow up a balloon, it is much easier to stretch the balloon before blowing it up; your vocal chords function in much the same way.)
                
4.Start with songs that are in your vocal range. Covering territory you're already comfortable with will continue to warm up your voice before you try to train it to do anything new. Consider choosing a song that has a few notes slightly above your usual range and make these your goal   
Practice scales, gradually increasing the pitch each time. Remember that your vocal chords are delicate membranes and must be eased into any new techniques.
                  
5.Train your body to hit the high notes. As you sing the note, press your lower belly in but keep your upper belly out; this is called a “lower belly boost.” Drop your lower jaw dramatically but keep your mouth opened narrowly. Bend your knees slightly to make yourself feel like you're moving downwards as your voice goes up. Try to minimize the height to which you lift your larynx up as you increase your pitch; though this is what people naturally do when raising their voices, this strains your throat and can cause your voice to crack. Monitor this by placing your fingers above your larynx while you sing and adjusting your technique to keep the larynx down.
Don’t look up while you sing high notes; keep your vision directly in front of you to avoid bending your throat and straining the sound.
Sticking your tongue forward may help give the high notes a richer sound.
                  
6.Always remember to not strain your voice. Don't try to force yourself into a much higher register too quickly; there are often serious consequences when you do. Remember to always drink water before a performance or practice, which will keep your voice steady. Keep one near you for emergencies as well.
